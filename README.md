# Simple Chatbot with Flask

A very basic intent-based chatbot built using **Flask**, **NLTK**, and **TensorFlow**.  
This was one of my early practice projects to understand how chatbots work with intents, tokenization, and a simple neural network.

### Features
- Rule-based intents stored in `intents.json`
- Bag-of-words model with NLTK lemmatization
- Simple neural network for intent classification
- Flask backend with a minimal frontend

### Note
This is a **practice project** and not meant for production use.  
Built during my early learning phase to experiment with chatbot fundamentals.
